Reflex AG Grid: Powerful Data Tables for Your Python Web Apps

Reflex AG Grid is a high-performance and highly customizable component library for working with tabular data in Reflex applications. It seamlessly integrates the powerful AG Grid library into the Reflex ecosystem, bringing advanced data grid capabilities to Python developers building modern web applications.

## Why Reflex AG Grid?

As Reflex gained traction in the Python web development community, we saw a growing demand for more sophisticated data handling components. Many developers who had experience with AG Grid in other frameworks were eager to leverage its capabilities in their Reflex projects. In response to this demand, we're excited to introduce Reflex AG Grid as a first-class citizen in the Reflex component ecosystem!

You can start building powerful data-driven applications with Reflex AG Grid today! Simply install it using pip: 

```bash
pip install reflex-ag-grid
```

(Note: This is an initial release. Check our the [open source repo](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex-ag-grid) for the latest version and any updates. Join our mailing list to stay informed about new features and releases.)


## What is AG Grid?

[AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com) is a feature-rich data grid library designed for displaying and manipulating tabular data in web applications. With over a million monthly downloads, and 90% of the Fortune 500 comapnies using it, it's a leading solution for working with tabular data. AG Grid offers a wide array of functionalities including:

In-place cell editing
Real-time data updates
Pagination and infinite scrolling
Column filtering, reordering, resizing, and hiding
Row grouping and aggregation
Built-in theming


The AG Grid team is dedicated to continually improving the library, ensuring it remains at the forefront of data grid technology.





## Reflex AG Grid vs. Reflex DataTable Components

While Reflex offers basic `rx.data_table` component out of the box, Reflex AG Grid takes data handling to the next level. If you're working with large datasets, need advanced filtering and sorting capabilities, or require features like editable cells and export options, Reflex AG Grid is the ideal choice.

Some key advantages of Reflex AG Grid include:

Superior performance with large datasets
Extensive customization options
Built-in features like column pinning and row grouping
Seamless integration with Reflex's reactive programming model
Support for both free (community) and enterprise features


Like Reflex itself, the core functionality of AG Grid is free and open-source. For those needing even more power, AG Grid offers an enterprise version with additional features such as pivot tables, advanced groupings, and Excel export capabilities. Reflex AG Grid supports both the community and enterprise versions â€“ you just need a valid AG Grid license key to unlock the enterprise features.
