We’re excited the announce the next major release of Reflex! 

With Reflex 0.4.0 we’re releasing new core components and a theming system that makes it easier to build apps that look great out of the box.

## Our Vision

Our goal at Reflex is to be the easiest way to go from an idea to a working web app.

Developers should be able to focus on high level ideas, not on implementation details.
At the same time, they should be able to customize any aspect of their app that they want, and not feel limited by the framework.

Since we launched Reflex, we’ve been working to maintain the balance of having an ergonomic, batteries-included web framework that is also flexible enough to handle any type of use case.

Reflex 0.4.0 takes another step in this direction with our new core components and themes.
The components come with high-level styling options, and different components within an app can be styled together with a unified theme.
If you want more customizability, you can modify any aspects of the component internals to suit your needs.
